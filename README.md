# RecomendationByMahout
1. We use Movielens datasets for our project and transform the data form for data model. 2. Use several different algorithms to calculate the similarity in users or items. 3 For user-based method, we need to do neighborhood calculation. 4 Use user-based CF and item-based CF to recommendation. 5 Design a evaluator to compare the results of different approaches.
